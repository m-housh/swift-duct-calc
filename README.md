Residential duct design software.

## Overview

This is the source code for [ductcalc.pro](https://ductcalc.pro) web site. Which is a residential
duct design software based on ACCA Manual-D. This is meant as a replacement for speed-sheet users or
people who are new / learning duct design concepts.

The web site is free to use, but this project is also setup to be self-hostable if that's your
preference.
