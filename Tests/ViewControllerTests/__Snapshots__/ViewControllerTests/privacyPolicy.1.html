          <p>
            Your information, including Personal Data, is processed at the Company's operating offices and in
            any other places where the parties involved in the processing are located. It means that this
            information may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of Your state,
            province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ from
            those from Your jurisdiction.
          </p>
          <p>
            Where required by applicable law, We will ensure that international transfers of Your Personal Data
            are subject to appropriate safeguards and supplementary measures where appropriate. The Company will
            take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that Your data is treated securely and in accordance
            with this Privacy Policy and no transfer of Your Personal Data will take place to an organization or
            a country unless there are adequate controls in place including the security of Your data and other
            personal information.

          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Delete Your Personal Data</h3>
          <p>
            You have the right to delete or request that We assist in deleting the Personal Data that We have
            collected about You.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our Service may give You the ability to delete certain information about You from within the
            Service.

          <p>
            You may update, amend, or delete Your information at any time by signing in to Your Account, if you
            have one, and visiting the account settings section that allows you to manage Your personal

            You have provided to Us.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please note, however, that We may need to retain certain information when we have a legal obligation
            or lawful basis to do so.
          </p>
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Disclosure of Your Personal Data</h3>
          <h4 class="text-lg font-bold">Business Transactions</h4>
          <p>
            If the Company is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, Your Personal Data may be
            transferred. We will provide notice before Your Personal Data is transferred and becomes subject to
            a different Privacy Policy.
          </p>
          <h4 class="text-lg font-bold">Law enforcement</h4>
          <p>
            Under certain circumstances, the Company may be required to disclose Your Personal Data if required
            to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g. a court or a government
            agency).
          </p>
          <h4 class="text-lg font-bold">Other legal requirements</h4>
          <p>
            The Company may disclose Your Personal Data in the good faith belief that such action is necessary
            to:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc mx-6 space-y-2">

          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Security of Your Personal Data</h3>
          <p>
            The security of Your Personal Data is important to Us, but remember that no method of transmission
            over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While We strive to use
            commercially reasonable means to protect Your Personal Data, We cannot guarantee its absolute
            security.

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Children's Privacy</h2>
          <p>
            Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 16. We do not knowingly collect personally
            identifiable information from anyone under the age of 16. If You are a parent or guardian and You
            are aware that Your child has provided Us with Personal Data, please contact Us. If We become aware
            that We have collected Personal Data from anyone under the age of 16 without verification of
            parental consent, We take steps to remove that information from Our servers.
          </p>
          <p>
            If We need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing Your information and Your country
            requires consent from a parent, We may require Your parent's consent before We collect and use that
            information.
